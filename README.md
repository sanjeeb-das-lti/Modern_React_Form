This is a custom component created to showcase the Form component using ReactJS and Formik as the main form validator and manager.

Formik is a library that helps with the 3 most annoying parts:

1. Getting values in and out of form state
2. Validation and error messages
3. Handling form submission
By colocating all of the above in one place, Formik will keep things organized--making testing, refactoring, and reasoning about your forms a breeze.

Yup: Yup is a JavaScript object schema validator. While it has many powerful features, most importantly it helps create custom validation rules.

Hooks used in this project to navigate to another page on succesfull form validation are:

1. useNavigate: Used to navigate to another page on any form action with the form data
2. useLocator: Used to access the current location with the state
